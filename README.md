# Puget-Sound-Dive-Planning
Examining the correlation between lunar phases and their impact on tides and currents at dive sites in the Puget Sound to enhance safety.
## Objective

This project seeks to explore the intricate relationship between lunar phases, tides, and underwater currents at four key dive sites in Puget Sound, Washington. It aims to provide valuable insights into how these natural elements influence scuba diving conditions and safety. By addressing specific research questions and hypotheses, this project intends to enhance our understanding of dive site variability, identify potential patterns, and offer recommendations for safer and more enjoyable scuba diving experiences in Puget Sound. The project will utilize data analysis and visualization techniques to uncover significant findings, ultimately benefiting the diving community and fostering awareness of the dynamic underwater environment in this region.

## Data Sources

1. Tide and Current Data: NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) - Puget Sound Tides and Currents Data
2. Lunar Data: Astronomical Applications Department of the U.S. Naval Observatory
3. Dive Site Information: Local dive shops

## Research Questions

The following research questions were addressed:

1. How do lunar phases influence underwater currents and tidal conditions at Puget Sound dive sites?
2. Are there differences in underwater conditions between dive sites?
3. How can we enhance scuba dive safety and enjoyment by understanding these factors?

## Data cleaning and preprocessing involved:

- Formatted columns to ensure correct data types.
- Split and reorganized columns for uniformity.
- Eliminated leading spaces and enforced standardized naming conventions.
- Managed duplicate values and missing data.
- Merged datasets for comprehensive analysis.
- Maintained index consistency and removed irrelevant columns.
- Improved data quality by creating subsets, eliminating NaN values, and applying filters.
